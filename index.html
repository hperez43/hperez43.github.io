I started down the path of Computer Science for its versatility. The idea that a degree in CS was an open door to just about anywhere because the intellectual qualities needed for such an endeavor would be favorable in any job market. I could have access to the well funded CS jobs as well as any other non-CS job because my chosen field of study demonstrated a certain level of technical skill and an engineering mindset. 
The broad, multifaceted ? Of computer Science also became a hurdle. A year into my studies what was first a universal key to employability became a vast ocean of possibilities that I was drowning in.
